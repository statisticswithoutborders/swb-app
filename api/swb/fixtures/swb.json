The webinars were a combination of lectures introducing basic concepts and terminology, and discussions about how to improve on-going projects. One of the SWB volunteers now has a connection to the Asante team and will continue to serve as a mentor.",

Sponsorship-funded programming operates in the areas of maternal and child health, early childhood care and development, basic education, school health and nutrition, and adolescent development. This valuation focuses on educational and early childhood interventions. Data will be collected every two years from 2017 and continuing through 2027. Statistical challenges include analysis of missing data, definition of random effects and correlation structure, use of propensity scores, and causal inference. SWB’s team includes a graduate student and a medical school professor, both in the US, a post-doctoral fellow in Spain and a semi-retired academic researcher from Canada.",

      "project_description": "Description: Since 1995, Tacugama Chimpanzee Sanctuary has rescued and rehabilitated nearly 200 orphaned and illegally traded western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus). SWB did two projects for Tacugama in 2018. In a fairly rapid 3-month project, one of our Masters-level statisticians analyzed before-and-after data from an environmental awareness campaign conducted by the conservation manager in order to reduce the negative impact of construction along the Bandajuma-Jendema road near the Liberian border. McNemar's test was used to demonstrate the success of the campaign in improving awareness of the illegality of chimpanzee trading and risks associated with bushmeat consumption. GLMM models indicated that individuals who encounter bushmeat and/or use it as part of their daily lives may lack a corresponding awareness of the health risks, and be at highest risk for diseases such as Ebola. SWB was asked to investigate the causes of an ataxia-like mystery disease responsible for the deaths of over 50 chimpanzees since 2005. Tacugama veterinarians have long recognized important risk factors such as time of year and forested enclosure but were anxious to investigate further. The SWB team included a medical school professor and a recent graduate in Industrial Engineering. Project work continued for nearly a year while SWB volunteers explored the data with Cox survival analysis, competing risk plots, and CART models. We also created an electronic database for the veterinarians, enabling them to record more types of data in a consistent and easily accessible form.",

By request from Luis Hernando Aguilar of the Cluster at the time, a team of six SWB volunteers - from England, France, Kenya, the Netherlands, and the United States - spent one month completing and documenting an automatic data compilation system using ETL scripts in R to replace Excel macros. The scripts helped optimize the ETL processes, reducing effort time, minimizing error risks, and improving the quality of the data that were the basis for decision making.",
