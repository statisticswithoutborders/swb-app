# Statistics Without Borders - Frontend documentation

Statistics Without Borders (SWB) is a volunteer Outreach Group of the American Statistical Association that provides pro bono services in statistics and data science. As a cohort, we worked together to redesign their existing website from a mockup utilizing React for the front end. We broke down the mockup into molecular and atomic components and worked on those components. We designed the pages by combining the necessary components. Once we completed the design, we moved on to testing the components using enzyme and jest.
