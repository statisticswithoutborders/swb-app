              Statistics Without Borders (SWB) is a volunteer Outreach Group of
              the American Statistical Association (ASA) that provides pro bono
              services in statistics and data science. We work to improve
              decision making and knowledge in efforts that promote welfare
              through the proper application of statistical principles and best
              practices, where access to such resources is limited.

              SWB was established in 2008 and provides a focus for pro bono
              statistical consulting within the American statistical
              Association. SWB provides an opportunity for statisticians to
              collaborate with professionals, researchers, and other volunteers
              involved in international health work.

              SWB arose fromt the excitment generated by a topic-contributed
              panel entitled "Statisticians: Speaking Out and Reaching Out on
              Global Health" at the 2008 Joint Statistical Meetings in Denver,
              Colorado. Steve Pierson, Gary Shapiro, Jim Cochran, and Fritz
              Scheuren established Statistics Without Borders as an effort
              within the ASA's Special Interest Group (SIG) on Volunteerism.
              Established in 2005, the SIG on Volunteerism provided pro bono
              statistical consulting internationally, with a focus on human
              rights issues.

          <p>
            In 2017, the American Statistical Association and SWB explored how
            to move SWB from an outreach group to a more established entity
            within ASA that continues to reflect its unique characteristics. It
            also explicitly recognized that SWB is accountable to the ASA Board
            and that SWB volunteers are expected to adhere to the ASA Ethical
            Guidelines for Statistical Practice. This gives SWB financial
            support from ASA and the ability for SWB to manage limited funds in
            a manner similar to that of the ASA chapters and sections.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            SWB is grateful for the assistance and leadership provided by
            Broadgreen Solutions. Broadgreen Solutions, a Certified B Corp that
            provides transformation and advisory services, performed exhaustive
            interviews with SWB Executive Committee members, ASA leadership, SWB
            organizational partners and other non-profit volunteer associations
            to discuss the pros and cons of organizational structure, and
            provided SWB with recommmendations on our future roadmap. SWB also
            thanks ASA Associate Executive Director Steve Porzio for his
            invaluable guidance.
          </p>
          <p>
            SWB has grown substantially over the past decade. This rapid growth
            has enabled SWB to take on more projects, but it has also required
            the Executive Committe to rethink both of its organizational
            structure, policies, and procedures. Ultimately, the goal of the SWB
            Executive Committee is to improve the ability of SWB to be an
            effective organization promoting the greater good through
            statistical practice, and do so as an integral part of the ASA
            organization. SWB looks forward to these positive changes.
